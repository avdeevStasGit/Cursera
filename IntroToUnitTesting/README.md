Building Unit Tests with JUnit
==============================
In this assignment, you'll get some practice at building effective unit tests. Using the example from our videos, you'll be developing tests for the Demo class, including the isTriangle() and main() methods.

Your task is to create a file, DemoTest.java, which properly tests the Demo class to ensure it is working properly. The correct Demo.java file is provided for your use.

Below, are instructions to get you started.  We provide instructions for building and running the tests.  We've provided you with the files needed to get you started.  Information about the directory structure is also included below.

### Deliverable
Your deliverable is the `DemoTest.java` which tests the Demo class.

### Evaluation
In order to measure the adequacy of your tests, we will be using mutation analysis. We have generated many variations of the Demo.java file, each with a single fault introduced. These faults (mutations) include things like swapping a binary operator for another (e.g., '+' instead of '-'), or changing the variable used for another variable of the same type (e.g., 'a' substituted for 'b').
